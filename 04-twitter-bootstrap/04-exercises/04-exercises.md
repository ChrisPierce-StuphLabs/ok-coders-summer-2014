Complete all homework assignments before coming to the next class or as otherwise instructed.

## Create an express app for bootstrap practice

**Create a new express app**

Similar to the previous homework assignment, create a new Express web application. Do not reuse previous express applications. The intent is to practice using the command line and creating applications from scratch quickly.

**Grab the html from this repository**

Copy all the html files from the public directory in this repository into the public directory of your express application. Actually, for this lesson you could create the html files from scratch, because the html files in this repository are empty placeholders.

**Install bootstrap**

Download the bootstrap files and place them into the correct directories. Remember to use the *javascripts* instead of *js* and *stylesheets* instead of *css* directories in your express application.

**Create a web site**

For this assignment you will create the files from scratch. I've added an empty file for each page. You will generate all the html. Base your html on the Bootstrap Basic Template we used in class, but don't forget to correct the `link` and `script` tags.

The site should have the following characteristics:

**Navigation and container**

Each page should have a working bootstrap-based *navigation bar* with links to all the other pages that also indicates the current page. Each page should also have a *container* div that contains the rest of the page.

**Index.html**

The index is the front landing page for the site. Use the *jumbotron* component and *panels* to highlight features of the site. Make up marketing copy (text) for a data analysis firm and add images.

**About.html**

Create an about page that describes the business and the team. Add images for team members. The images should be circles, but don't edit square images. Use bootstrap's support for making a rectangular image appear circular. Again, make up the copy (text contents).

**Signup.html**

Create a sign up page for the firm's product. Create a form using bootstrap's form classes. Your sign up form should require an email address and password. No username and no password confirmation field. Include a signup button. Center the form on the page so that it doesn't take up the entire width.

**Reports.html**

The reports page uses bootstrap's *grid system* for layout. This is where your customers go to view the data reports available to them. Use bootstrap's grid system to create a two column layout. The left column is the sidebar (width:4) that contains a *list group* component. The right column is the main content area (width:8) and should include a sample report or chart. If you're feeling brave, try incorporating one of the examples from [D3.js](http://d3js.org/), even if you don't understand javascript yet.

## Review css selectors and properties

Mozilla has excellent css documention. Review the properties list and make sure you understand selectors. We'll be using them with JavaScript as well.

[Mozilla's CSS Documentation](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Reference): The goto reference for css questions.

[Code Academy CSS Practice](http://www.codecademy.com/tracks/web): Practice html and css at Code Academy.

## Review the command line and git

Two free books on the command line and on git were mentioned in class. Consider these books textbooks and study them.

[The Linux Command Line, by William Shots](http://linuxcommand.org/tlcl.php) : Read past the first four chapters. Start to get into the advanced material likes pipes and redirection.

[Pro Git](http://git-scm.com/book) : Make sure you have read the first two chapters, Getting Started and Git Basics, and begin working on branching in chapter three.

## Keep learning JavaScript

We start JavaScript programming next week! Make sure you come to class prepared. We will use the excellent and free [Eloquent JavaScript](http://eloquentjavascript.net/) for this class.

Read and practice with the first four chapters by the beginning of next week. Don't put this off! 

If you would like additional JavaScript practice, sign up for a free account at [Code Academy](http://www.codecademy.com/) and begin working through their JavaScript lessons.
