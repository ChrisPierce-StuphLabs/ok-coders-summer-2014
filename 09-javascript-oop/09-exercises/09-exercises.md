OK Coders: Lesson 9 Exercises
=================================

The homework assignments are contained in the .js files included in this repository. Download this repository as a zip file to your computer usign the Download Zip button on the bottom right of this page, or clone this repository using git. At the command line, cd into a directory and type:

	# git clone https://github.com/okcoders/js-object-oriented-homework.git
	
Which will create a new "js-object-oriented-homework" folder in that directory. All the .js files will be in there.

Read through each javascript file and complete the assignments it contains. Further instructions are provided in each file. In general you will edit each file and run it from the command line using node until the output matches the instructions or all the tests are passing.

## Create a Heroku Homework Site

It's been a few weeks since we used node, express and heroku to create a website, but it's time to review!

Create a new express application. Create two html files in the public folder, `functions.html` and `objects.html`, one for your functions homework assignment and one for the objects homework assignment in this repository. Add twitter bootstrap styling to the pages, and link to each page from the other.

Embed your solutions for today's homework assignment into their respective pages. For example, you will have an implementation for the `select` function in the `higher-order.js` file. Embedd your javascript code into the `functions.html` file so that you can view it in a web browser. See the **Code** section in the **CSS** document on the twitter bootstrap homepage for information on which tag to use to get your formatting right, and refer to the `example.html` file in this repository for help.

Create a git repository for your express application and then create a heroku application for it and upload it to heroku.

You'll probably need to review some of the old lesson material:
