===================================

The homework assignments are contained in the .js files included in this repository. Download this repository as a zip file to your computer usign the Download Zip button on the bottom right of this page, or clone this repository using git. At the command line, cd into a directory and type:

	$ git clone https://github.com/okcoders/js-objects-arrays-homework.git	
Which will create a new "js-objects-arrays-homework" folder in that directory. All the .js files will be in there.

	$ node arrays.js
	test 1 passed
	test 2 failed *
	test 3 failed *
	test 4 failed *
	test 5 failed *
	test 6 failed *
	test 7 failed *
	test 8 failed *
	test 9 failed *

## Code Academy

Continue working through the [Code Academy JavaScript](http://www.codecademy.com/tracks/javascript) lessons. There is almost certainly not enough practice in this homework, and you want to get as much practice as possible with the basics.

## Eloquent JavaScript

Continue reading [Eloquent JavaScript](http://eloquentjavascript.net/contents.html). Review the first four chapters, which you should have already read, and move on to the chapters on Data Strutures, Functional programming and Object-oriented Programming.
